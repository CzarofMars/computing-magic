Some parts of this document are still related to an earlier version. Some parts
of this document are too detailed and either need to be condensed or provided
with a tl;dr summary. Other parts are too brief or are unclear and require
expansion. There is missing material needed to bridge some of the parts. There
is material which is entirely missing! Your assistance can make a difference!

It would be great to begin with a succinct Case for Action!

Many if not most of the /italicized/ terms in the document should become foreign
hyperlinks. The acronyms should be glossed, e.g. with hovers, popups or links.

*** Why We Need A Data Storage Manifesto

How we store /Data/ and /Information/ underlies everything we do with
/Computers/. (Since Information has to be /Encoded/ as Data, we'll use Data as
the inclusive term.) Awkwardness in Data Storage undermines our creative
expression and the success of our projects. There are opportunities to greatly
improve our reach and our effectiveness using existing techniques and available
technologies. Modest improvements to existing technologies offer even greater
rewards. Improvements which would once have exacted too much /Administrative/
effort to /Install/ and /Maintain/ can now be copied and deployed as /VMs/. It's
time to move the state of the art forward and reap the rewards!

Summary
- Our current systems often work poorly
- There are better strategies we can use now
- We can improve our systems to do much better

*** We're Assuming That You Are

The author(s) are assuming that you, dear reader, have some r√¥le in using
computers creatively to solve problems which require some amount of well-managed
data.

We do /not/ assume you have an extensive technical computing background. If you
do, you can skim or skip much of this document - but try not to miss the good
parts! If you don't have a strong technical computing background you may want to
skim over some of the material on the first read-through and then come back and
gradually read everything - perhaps more than once! Eventually you'll want to
follow some of the links.

We hope that you find the document Interesting and at least Potentially Useful.
We hope that some of you will join us in developing, documenting, improving
and/or packaging some of the techniques we mention here. We would love your
assistance in making this document better for people like you! To that end,
please feel free to post issues and especially to fork and improve this document
and send us pull requests!

** The State of Data Management in the World Today

Storing /Digital/ data and information efficiently and reliably has been a major
challenge since the beginning of computing. Creating good solutions in this area
has given meaningful careers to a small number of scientists and engineers. As
in many other areas of human endeavor, good solutions are regularly ignored or
incorrectly used. Dealing with problems caused by storage methods has created a
huge amount of mind-numbing maintenance work for computer /Operators/ and
/Administrators/. Data Storage issues have created obstacles and frustration for
both amateur and professional /Developers/ attempting to solve important
problems for humanity. Even when projects succeed, information is regularly
corrupted, lost or inappropriately leaked.

There are lots of storage techniques which work for special kinds of data. There
are only a few kinds of techniques which work reasonably well for almost all
kinds of on-line data, i.e. data which is immediately available to currently
running programs. The two principal methods are Filesystems and Database
Management Systems. Although most on-line data is currently stored in
Filesystems, this Manifesto claims that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database#RDBMS][Relational Database Management Systems]] -
suitably configured and deployed - should be strongly preferred.

*** Most On-Line Data Lives In Filesystems

 Most on-line data is stored in /Posix/ (/Unix/-style) or similar /Filesystems/.
 Within Filesystems, data is stored in /Files/ which consist of /Byte
 Sequences/. /Textfiles/ consist of Byte Sequences encoding text which is
 readable by both humans and computer programs. All other files are called
 /Binary files/ which consist of sequences of bytes encoded in a myriad of
 formats readable only by carefully written computer software. These Files are
 indexed by /Directories/, also known as /Folders/.

 Filesystems also associate /Metadata/ with Files and Directories, such as
 ownership, timestamps and access permissions. For the rest of this document we
 will be ignoring Directories and Filesystem Metadata in order to concentrate on
 the manner in which Data is stored as Byte Sequences in Files.

 Files are popular because they impose the least constraint on the structure of
 data. Applications with permission to create and modify files can write any
 sequence they wish and modify any part of a file at will. It is up to the
 applications which access those files to interpret the meaning, if any, of the
 contents. Once a Posix Filesystem allows a program write access to a file or
 directory, no attempt is made by the system to maintain any integrity in the
 contents the of files or to protect data from being lost or misinterpreted.

 /Operating Systems/ generally include general, stable and efficient Filesystems
 as a standard feature. Operating systems are expected to ensure the integrity
 of the Filesystem, i.e. preserving the structure of the byte structure of
 files, the structure of Directories and the Metadata is reliable - even while
 providing no protection against (or awareness of) corruption caused by
 erroneous operations of authorized applications.

 By the way, computer storage devices, /Physical Hardware/ such as /Hard
 Drives/, /SSDs/, /DVDs/, /Thumbdrives/, etc. do not directly provide
 Filesystems, Files or Folders. Filesystems are a /System Abstraction/ provided
 by the Filesystem software of the Operating System which insulates users and
 programs from the diverse low-level storage structures of physical media.

*** Important On-Line Data Often Lives In Databases

 Some highly important data is stored in /Relational Database Management
 Systems/ which maintain integrity and accessibility even when some data is used
 by multiple applications at the same time, even when some of those applications
 might be altering the information at the same time it's being accessed!
 Metadata called a /Schema/ specifies the structure of the data along with
 integrity constraints. It is not possible for applications modifying the data
 to violate the Schema. Some of the most advanced RDBMSs, such as PostgreSQL,
 even allow the Schema to be altered at the same time as the data is being
 accessed and modified, without danger of corruption or misinterpretation!

 Operating Systems /do not/ generally provide general, stable and efficient
 Database Management Systems. Properly adding a good DBMS requires significant
 computer administrative expertise. Maintaining a good DBMS over time, as
 updates are applied to all parts of the system (including hardware updates,
 software security and version updates, etc.) has generally been considered the
 job of a highly skilled professional systems administrator. It is no surprise
 that amateur users of personal computers and amateurs building websites on
 stock servers generally do so without the advantages of a good DBMS.

 Recently pre-packaged services, such as DBMSs, have become available as
 /Virtual Machines/ which can be easily installed and updated by unskilled
 users. VMs can allow developers to leverage advanced DBMSs without the support
 of professional administrators! It is still necessary for someone to package
 advanced DBMSs into VMs in an easily exploited configuration and to educate
 Developers in how to use them effectively.

 And for the foreseeable future, it will still be necessary for developers to
 understand and work with files, especially Textfiles. Indeed, the
 /Configuration/, /Metadata Schemas/ and /Query Commands/ of Database Systems
 are commonly stored as Textfiles and managed using /Text Editors/!

** Leveraging Files and especially Textfiles

In order to understand how to do things better, it helps to understand current
practices and a bit about how we got to them!

If this seems overly detailed, take heart: We left out almost everything!

*** Unix and its Descendants Took Over The World

Operating Systems used to be more ambitious and more complex than the ones
popular today. Many Operating Systems developed before 1970 attempted to
regulate and protect the integrity of the contents of files. These mechanisms
were too complex for the early Mini-Computer and Micro-Computer systems of the
1970s and 1980s. The developers of Unix suggested that an Operating System
could give up responsibility for the contents of files and simply store the
contents as a sequence of bytes. It would be the responsibility of Application
and Utility Programs to interpret those Bytes Sequences through explicit
programming. Because providing specialized programs for every kind of data
would require too much programming, the inventors of Unix suggested storing
most data in the form of Textfiles, so that humans could immediately understand
the contents. To go with this approach Unix provided a suite of programs as
part of the /Unix Programmers' Workbench/, which could flexibly manipulate
structured information stored in Textfiles.

The most powerful tools in the Workbench were Text Editors which allowed the
contents of Textfiles to be modified either /Interactively/ by a human /User/
or automatically by a /Script/ - a sequence of commands which could be stored
in yet another Textfile! This helped create the Unix Power User Philosophy:
Power Users could issue commands interactively via a /Shell/ and later combine
those commands with control logic in a /Script/. Scripts were useful when you
wanted to do roughly the same sequence of commands again and again. A script
both automates an otherwise tedious task and also documents the procedure used
since it consists of a Textfile detailing that procedure using familiar
commands. (We're stressing these points because they will be a key part of the
Manifesto later!) Even Unix Programmers used the system this way, rarely
writing programs in traditional programming languages which greatly increased
their productivity.

Because it allowed Operating Systems to be simpler and smaller, the basic
elements of the Unix Filesystem Design was adopted by all major (surviving)
Modern Operating Systems. Microsoft copied the Unix File and Directory system
in /MS-DOS 4.2/ and continued it with every version of /Microsoft Windows/. The
/University of California at Berkeley/ created the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution][Berkeley Software
Distribution]] as an advanced version of Unix. /BSD/ became the testbed for the
networking software which evolved into /The Internet/. BSD, often erroneously
called "Berkeley Unix", became the basis for all of Apple's Operating Systems
after Steve Jobs resumed the helm. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel][Linux Kernel]] was created to provide the
services of the pre-existing Unix and BSD Kernels as FLOSS - Free/Libre Open
Source Software, unencumbered by any Proprietary "Intellectual Property".
Linux, and the [[https://www.gnu.org][GNU System]] implemented on top of it, are protected by the [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#GPL][Gnu
Public License]] which makes sure that it continues to be free to use and modify
by developers. The Linux Kernel is the basis of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)][Google's Android OS]] and of the
many versions of GNU/Linux. [[https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-linux-faq.html#why][GNU/Linux]] (often confusingly just called Linux) is
the basis for a vast number of specialized [[https://distrowatch.com/][Linux Distributions]] such as Red Hat,
Ubuntu, Mint, etc. These highly customizable GNU/Linux Distributions run most
of the World's [[https://itsfoss.com/linux-runs-top-supercomputers][Supercomputers]], Enterprise Servers, provide most of the
infrastructure of the Internet and hide within an increasing number of our
ubiquitous computer-controlled appliances.

All modern computers are descendants of those early microcomputer systems - the
first systems with their entire CPU on one silicon chip. And although today's
computers are vastly more powerful than the most powerful computers of the
past, our modern operating systems have continued to be based on strategies to
avoid a level of overhead that we would now consider trivial to support!

*** Raw Byte-Sequence Files in the Modern World

Since Unix-like Operating Systems have no way to manage the contents of files,
any datafile with unknown provenance must be considered to possibly be
corrupted. Attempts to use a file while it is being modified by another program
can easily happen by accident and lead to misinterpretation of the file's
contents and is a common cause of file corruption.

*** Raw Binary Files in the Modern World

The format of binary data files must be managed by specialized computer
software, either written into a simple program or packaged as a library if that
format must be managed by multiple programs. These programs and libraries have
limited ability to deal with (or even notice) when the format of a binary file
deviates from what a programmer expected. A frequent cause of errors occurs
when a data format is updated, e.g. to support a new feature, leading to a new
/version/ of a /data format/. A file which used to be correct will now cause a
problem when it is /opened/ by a newer program. Similarly, a program which used
to work perfectly will now get in trouble when it opens a file using a newer
version of the formatting scheme. Failure to manage these problems regularly
leads to calamities: systems crashing, security failures, data loss, incorrect
reports, etc. Such problems have led to injuries, deaths and the failures of
projects, careers and companies.

*** Raw Textfiles in the Modern World

Like Binary Files, Textfiles come in many specialized and often complex formats,
indicated by special characters indicating syntax. Despite the idea of Textfiles
being transparent, a human unfamiliar with the syntax may not understand or may
misunderstand the content. Terrible problems are caused when Textfiles are
editing by Users who do not understand the syntax!

A new issue comes from the recent demand for Textfiles to be able to represent
more than just [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII][English]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1][Western European]] characters. The world has now mostly
adopted a system called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode][Unicode]], but Unicode keeps evolving - and there is more
than one way of representing Unicode - and alas, the standard does specify any
metadata to indicate which Unicode version or encoding is intended! One system
may write a file using a particular Unicode version and encoding which another
system tries to interpret using a different Unicode version or encoding. The
world is gradually converging to a file encoding called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8][utf8]]. Additional
confusion is caused because there's no standard way of providing an intelligible
transliteration of a character set for a human unfamiliar with it. Con artists
have fooled users using a series of characters that look familiar but are
actually foreign lookalikes - this has been used to trick users into trusting
foreign websites, etc.

Under Posix, any supposed Textfile can actually contain any Byte Sequence,
possibly deeply into the file. Such characters may have an unknown effect on the
interpretation of the file as input to a program. Any Unicode Textfile can can
contain invalid Unicode encodings which, once again, can have an unpredictable
effect on the interpretation of the file by a program.

For historical reasons (that should long ago have become obsolete!) many
software tools require Textfiles to consist of fairly short lines of less
than 81 characters. Textfiles often look terrible when displayed in windows
that are too narrow or two wide! Line breaks are syntactically significant
in many Text Formats so tools for reflowing cannot be used. 'Beautifying"
programs are available for many important Text formats, to rearrange the
content to be more consistent and more readable.

All these problems aside, unlike Binary Files, Textfiles can be inspected by
Humans without specialized software. A human familiar with a particular Textfile
Format can often spot formatting problems by eye and correct the problems with a
general-purpose text editor - either interactively or with a script.

What kinds of Textfile formats are there, what do they look like, what do they do?

Much highly important data is stored as text files with complex syntactic
structure.  There are thousands of formats, such as
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markup_languages][Markup Languages]]
 - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML][XML]] - a general-purpose or "Meta" Document Language, including
   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument][OpenDocument]] - for "Office" Documents
   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML][HTML]] Web Document Language - for Web Page Content
   - [[https://orgmode.org][OrgMode]] - Organize your whole line in text!
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file][Traditional Configuration Files]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS][CSS]] - for styling Web Pages
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages][Programming languages]] - source is almost always structured text
  - These generally require highly trained users, e.g. programmers and very
    powerful software tools (parsers, etc.) to work with.
- And so much more!  Only C-3PO knows them all!

*** Source Files Are Moving To Git!

In computer parlance, Source refers to content generated by humans. Source
Files are files containing Source, usually in some sort of Text format. In
the course of a creative project, Source Files undergo changes, often made
by multiple collaborators. Keeping track of all of the changes is the job
of Revision Management Systems.

Underlyingly, current Revision Management Systems work by identifying
sequences of lines which have changed between versions of Textfiles and
tagging them with metadata such as who made the change and when along with
a new version number.

The [[https://git-scm.com][Git]] Revision Control System is currently the most popular software for
managing the Source Files of a creative Project, whether it be a project to
write a book, create a website, write a computer program or a wide range of
other possibilities. A collection of Files (and possibly Folders, so a
/Filesystem Tree/) managed by Git is called a Repository.

A Git Repository can be stored and managed on any computer, but for
convenience of collaboration it is convenient to have a copy of the
Repository on a Server which may (or may not) be public and may (or may
not) provide the Repository as a Website. Many Project Repositories are
hosted on private servers and many are hosted on Commercial Servers such as
- [[https://github.com][GitHub]]
- [[https://about.gitlab.com][GitLab]]
Both GitHub and GitLab provide free hosting for small projects to individuals
and to organizations for FLOSS projects, a policy which greatly increases their
popularity and therefore their market recognition!

Current Revision Control Systems have some serious limitations, such as 
- Changes need to make sense as changes to a subset of lines
  - Changes in indentation and line breaks appear as complete rewrites
- Git has trouble with
  - Files with very long lines
  - Very large files
  - Binary Files

However, Git (and most other Revision Control Systems) add some very important
features which Posix Filesystems do not provide:
- Git-managed files do not actually change!
  - "Changes" always create new versions
  - Older versions can always be recovered
  - Data can't be lost without removing the whole repository!
- Repositories can be copied and "modified" independently
  - After diverging, separate repositories can be recombined
  - Older incompatible changes simply show up as additional versions
- Git creates a "hash" or "checksum" of all files
  - a Checksum is a large number derived from the content of a file
  - a Checksum can ensure that the content of a file has not changed
  - Checksums are an excellent support for data integrity
- Replications of Git Repositories provide excellent backups!

** How We Can Improve Data Storage


We claim that almost all of the practices involving Files, Folders, Filesystem
Metadata and Revision Control Systems will work better if we move all of the
data into a Modern Relational Datbase Management System.

We will give examples of how all of the desirable properties of Filesystems
listed above can be retained and how all of the undesirable properties can be
overcome.

We will list additional advantages and also some drawbacks or costs.


We will propose some extensions and changes to existing RDBMSs which will add
still more advantages and reduce or remove some of the drawbacks.

We will suggest some tactical and stragic plans for obtaining these advantages.

*** Some Desirable General Principles of Data Management

We list some general principles of Data Management which are not provided by
Posix Filesytems and are also not provided by regular RDBMSs "out of the box".

Desirable General Princples of Data Management
- Data should always be "checksummed"
- Data should be immutable where possible.
- Any changes in a data store should be tranactional.
- Changes should be monotonic when data can't be immutable.
- Data should be invisible to global processes where it is not monotonic.
- Global non-monotonic transactions should create new versions of the entire store
- The store should use "structure sharing" between revisions

Git provides a number of these features, but not for all kinds of files and it
can be subverted - it is just a convention layered on a conventional filesystem,
it has no means of enforcing any of these principles.

Some of the advanced Filesystems such as ZFS and Btrfs support some of these
features, but not all and not in a standard way.

Modern RDBMSs are transactional.

The original Postgres DBMS was monotonic: Deleting a tuple simply caused it's
close data to be filled in. Updating a field of a tuple caused its closed date
to be filled in and a new tuple to be created with the fields that had not
"changed" copied form the old tuple and the new data placed in the fields which
had "changed". By default, queries ignored tupples which were closed but if an
open or closed time range was added to a query it would consider any of the
closed tuples which were open during that time range. This feature was called
"Time Travel" and it was removed when Postgres dropped the Query Language from
the original Berkeley Project in favor of standard SQL and renamed Postgres to
PostgreSQL. 

All of these principles can be provided and enforced by the current PostgreSQL
RDBMS through its extension mechanism, while still retaining compatibility with
standards. For example, there's a contributed PostgreSQL extension which can
restore Time Travel for any set of tables, thus restoring monotonicity. Some
other RDBMSs have extension mechanisms which may be able to do the same.

*** Some Principles of Structured Documents

Structured documents are generally some kind of Tree or Forest of Trees,
possibly with further structure such as
- Namespaces defining Metadata Syntax
- HyperLinks to related content

XML would be much nicer if
- All metadata were expressed in element syntax
- Metadata syntax defined with Namespace URLs
- Classes clearly associated with specific namespaces
- Attributes associated with specific classes
- Expressed in something nice like CSS Selector Notation

Any such Tree/Forest structured documents should be stored in a database which
- Understands the hierarchical structure
- Does not introduce spurious line structure
- Understands metadata symbol scope
- Supports validity-preserving refactoring
- Supports path queries
- Integrates with Version Control
Simple changes in Symbol Names or structure
- Should be captured as simple transformations
- i.e. should not be viewed as "line changes"

While export/inport to/from text (and compressed) form should be supported,
Documents should normally be used either (1) interactively from a browser-like
interface or (2) programmatically using a mathematically clean command language.

*** Legacy Hardware Influences and New Possibilities

The original Postgres DBMS used an Optical Disk Jukebox as a Tertiary Store. The
Vacuum process would eventually move "closed" Tuples to the jukebox. Closed
Tuples would be consulted if a query gave a time range which included the time
after their Open Date and before their Closed Date. This was called "Time
Travel".

As Postgres was ported to production systems in the late 20th century which did
not have automated Tertiary Store and had limited Secondary Storage and as the
SQL Standard did not support "time travel" and the market did not expect such a
feature, time travel was removed - although the underlying MVCC representation
remains, along with the vacuum process which removes closed tuples
asynchronously from transactions.

Thus, because of lack of hardware resources and lack of vision, PostgreSQL lost
the monotonicity which was a key feature of Postgres.

**** Hard Drive RAID systems are now cheap!

With modern hard drive RAID systems, we can afford Time Travel and monotonic
storage!

**** 3D X-Point and similar tech is imminent

We should soon see the ready availability of persistent storage which is faster
than flash, does not have the write wear of flash and is no more expensive than
DRAM. Optane aka 3D X-Point is such a technology although it is not yet readily
available. Fast cheap persistent memory allows for much cheaper transactions and
indexes and persistent caches.

**** We should not expect a rush to restore monotonicity!

The lack of vision and market awareness of opportunities provided by the recent
abundances of hardware resources will tend to resist any restoration of lost
functionality, let alone new possibilities.

*** Some New Possibilities for Relational Database Management Systems

**** Better Type Systems in RDBMS Schemas

Modern Hindley-Millner type systems would greatly improve RDBMS Type Systems,
especially adding Sum Types.

Allowing all types to be first class would open up a world of possibilities,
e.g. Elements of Tuples could be Relations or Databases!

**** Versions and Monotonicity

Any transaction which created globally visible monotonicity could create a new
(structure sharing) Database, with a new version. Think of them like versions in
Git. New connections would default to the most recent version of a database
repository.

Rows of monotonic tables would automatically get unique integer keys, without
needing to store them. (They could then be given an appropriate type and
methods.)

**** Wicci-like Object References and Generic Operations

Row references would have static and (when necessary, also) dynamic types.

Generic operations would be associated with static object (tuple) types and
dispatched to type and table-specific methods.

**** Reproducible Caching Build-Systems for Constructed Blobs

RDBMSs usually have a way to store binary blobs when no other structure for the
data is available - and this needs to be at least as effective as the best
filesystem.

Most blobs have been constructed from a build process. Such a blob should be
primarily stored as its ingredients, with proper structural relationships and
relationships to the elements of the build process sufficient to allow a
reproducible build.

For efficiency, a binary blob which is expensive to build (like any value which
is expensive to compute) should cached and the cache invalidated (or relegated
to an earlier database version) when the structured data evolves.


** Scraps to work into the document or delete

*** Relational vs. Hierarchical vs. Network Database Management Systems

Somewhere put in the weird shunning of simple hierarchical strategies by RDBMSs,
e.g. the lack of hierarchical namespaces.

The Wicci would be a lot simpler if RDBMSs had better support for hierarchical
data - especially a superset of XML with real namespaces!

Somewhere put in the trick of using foo.bar or foo->bar in queries where foo
REFERENCES another TABLE with field bar. Allowing this and not needing to
manually put in a reference to bar's TABLE would simplify a lot of queries!
 

*** Git critical and aspirational

 
These files do not support the integrity provided by amount of important
information, especially information that is in (usually structured) text
formats - is now being stored using Git (or other version management)
Repositories. Git stores this text information by breaking it up into groups of
lines of lines without regard to the larger structure of those files. Accessing
the information requires checking the information out of the repository, an
expensive operation. Working with information from multiple versions or across
multiple repositories is awkward. Moving information among repositories is
awkward.

??? in Git files without regard to preserving efficient access to meaningul
operations on those files. The files have to be "checked out" how those into ,
mapped to Po , encoded in a wide variety of syntactically complex document
structures, e.g. markup languages

Experts have been aware of serious problems with Posix Filesystems, RDBMSs, Git
and markup languages since their inception. Ways to mitigate most of these
problems have been known by experts for a long time yet those mitigating
practices are not well followed. Superior alternatives to all of these systems
have been proposed and sometimes developed by creative experts only to fail to
gain traction.

*** Datalog

Somewhere mention Datalog and Datomic.
