Notes from the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/computing-magic][Computing Magic Project]].

** What should you do between Now and Next Saturday?

** The Key Tools

*** Emacs + StarterKit + Orgmode
**** Some Background
- Keyboards and Modifier Keys
   - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space-cadet_keyboard][The Space-Cadet Keyboard]]
   - Control :: for character-level operations
   - Meta ::  (usually Alt) for operations on larger syntactic units
   - Control-X Prefix :: for system operations, e.g. files
   - Control-C Prefix :: for local mode operations
   - Control-H Prefix :: for Help functions
- You can customize and extend your keyboard's modifier keys
    - [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=6645][Adding Hyper and Super Keys for Emacs]]
        - Read if on a Mac or if you have typing issues
**** Gestures call Lisp Functions
Emacs is a big bag of Lisp Functions.
- Meta-x :: Call a Lisp Function by name (with completion)
Keymaps bind shortcuts to functions
- Control-F :: =forward-char= move /point/ forward by =n= characters
- Meta-F :: =forward-word= move /point/ forward by =n= words
- Control-Meta-F :: move /point/ forward by =n= symbolic expressions
You can add your own /lisp functions/, /keymaps/ and /shortcuts/!

**** Emacs terminology is archaic but precise

- Buffers :: Hold your Bytes - /usually/ Text
   - /Buffers/ can be associated with /Files/ or /Processes/
   - Files and Processes can be /local/ or /remote/!
- Windows :: Display buffer contents for users
- Frames :: Hold /Windows/ on /Window Systems/
    -  /Frames/ are what most people would now call /Windows/
    -  /Windows/ are what some people would now call /Window Panes/

**** Emacs Starter Kits

You don't have to build a nice Emacs environment from scratch!
- [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/StarterKits][Emacs Starter Kits]]
- [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Prelude: Powerful but modest]]
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom: Somewhat modest and possibly Evil]]
- [[https://www.spacemacs.org][Spacemacs: Ambitious and possibly Evil]]

**** Emacs OrgMode

/OrgMode/ is unbelievably awesome.
- Really, you won't believe it,
- until you've discovered it for yourself!

There are /lots/ of good tutorials and videos for the many, many things you can
do with OrgMode.

-[[https://orgmode.org/][ Org Mode: Your life in plain text]]

*** The Unix/BSD/Linux/Posix Command Environment

**** Getting the Tools

If you have Unix, Linux or BSD you have the tools!

If you have a Mac you can install the latest tools using [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]].

If you have an older μSoft Windows machine, you can install everything using
[[https://cygwin.com/][Cygwin]]. For a newer μSoft Windows system, you can install μSoft's [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about][Windows
Subsystem for Linux]] free of charge.
 
***** Exploring the Posix Command Environment

Here's a great way to start:

- [[https://github.com/mks22-dw/bashcrawl][BASH Crawl - a shell adventure!]]
- [[https://marlborough-college.gitbook.io/attic-lab/the-terminal/games/level-1-bashcrawl][BASH Crawl Intro]]

Once you can run simple commands from a shell, you can move on. However, it will
be worth your while to intentionally explore the Unix Philosophy, especially in
regards to creative use of the Unix Tools.

An great beginning is to read chapters 1 - 6 of /The Unix Programming
Environment/ by Brian W. Kernigan and Rob Pike. Everything Unix-like since this
book was written builds on the foundation it describes, adding incremental power
and convenience but nothing radical.
- CONS:  It's somewhat out of date, although nearly everything still works.
- PROS:  It reveals the power and simplicity really well.
It would be great to bring it up to date
- without the massive feature creep since that time!

*** Git and Magit

Everyone is using Git!

Magit makes magic with Git within Emacs

I recommend that you have a GitHub account and create a private repository named
Notes which you clone on all of your devices!

** Announcement

Please join us tomorrow for our next discussion of Computing Magic. We will be beginning the transition from DrRacket to a more sophisticated development environment!
