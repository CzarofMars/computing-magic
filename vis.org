***** Alan Perlis
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
 #+END_QUOTE
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.
 #+END_QUOTE
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.
 #+END_QUOTE
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun
in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the
paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to
take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were
responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I
don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them
off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of
computer science never loses its sense of fun.

Syntactic sugar causes cancer of the semicolon.

One canâ€™t proceed from the informal to the formal by formal means
 #+END_QUOTE
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
The string is a stark data structure and everywhere it is passed there is much duplication of process. It is a perfect vehicle for hiding information.

***** Misc Quotes
 #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of
 feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional
 features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of
 rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed,
 suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible
 enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today.
