*  The Curriculum

** Summary

Go beyond developing computer programs the hard way, i.e. manually. Learn the
ost powerful [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm][programming paradigms]] and how to use meta-programming to generate
correct-by-construction code from your specifications. Along the way, you will
Build your own dynamic Web Server with a customizable back-end database. You
will wind up with l33t computing skills along with an extensible framework which
are beyond the current state of the art - all so you can accomplish your
ambitious goals.

** Strategy

1. Start from zero - Beginner's Mind
2. take the least cluttered and most general path, especially
- https://racket-lang.org/
- https://www.postgresql.org/
3. Pull in "computing magic" distinctions
- [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/new-rfcs/blob/main/vis-distinctions.org][vis-distinctions.org]]
- along with some other great resources

** Object-Level Plan

1. Work through the three short Racket tutorials as a mathematician would, i.e.
making it your own as you go through all of the steps:
- https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/
- https://docs.racket-lang.org/continue/index.html
- https://docs.racket-lang.org/more/index.html
2. Work though the PostgreSQL tutorial:
- https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/tutorial.html
3. Read and improve the Wicci
